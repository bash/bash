Hi there, I'm Ruben. ðŸ‘‹

My interests include:
* Software Development (Rust, C#, Web Stuffs, ...)
* Software Architecture (Clean Architecture, API Design)
* [Functional Programming](https://github.com/polyadic/funcky)
* Parsers

I'm currently studying mathematics at the [University of Zurich][UZH]. \
In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source and playing
story driven or puzzle games.
