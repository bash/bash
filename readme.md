Hi there, I'm Tau. ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently in a very deep rabbit hole trying
to bring automatic dark/light detection to
terminals and applications running inside terminals.

Some very rough notes can be found in my
[agenda](https://github.com/bash/terminal-dark-light-agenda) repository.

## Highlights

### [terminal-colorsaurus](https://github.com/bash/terminal-colorsaurus)
A library for answering the question Â«Is this terminal dark or light?Â» ðŸ¦• 

### [game-night](https://github.com/bash/game-night)
Source code for Tau's Game Night website.

### [fmtastic](https://github.com/bash/fmtastic)
A fantastic crate for fmting numbers using the appropriate unciode characters.

### [Funcky](https://github.com/polyadic/funcky)
Funcky is a library that empowers C# developers to write code using functional programming paradigms.
